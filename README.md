## Purpose

`joyboard` is a python program that sends keyboard signals from a joypad (like a xbox controller) 
so that you write from the joypad.
  
Currently, lower case letters and some punctuaction is all you can write.  
Also, you can delete characters (backspace), insert newline (enter), insert tab, and move the cursor.  
But, there many buttons and combos yet to create.
  
Conceptually, it should act kind of like a stenographic keyboard, writing full words with simultaneous key presses.


## Installation

```console
pip install joyboard
```
